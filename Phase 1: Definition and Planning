# The Project: A website with a booking system for a small business offering different Farm Experiences (name will be updated once I come up with something clever)

# User Personas

+ Business up and running before summer

Challenges:
+ Has a business idea and the facilities, but no website or social media to promote it or sell the service
+ Doesn't know anything about web development so can't do it on their own
+ The UI must be simple enough for easy use, tech fluency is not super high

#UI Prototypes

Right now I am thinking of making a sort of single page website structure for this apart from the booking features, but I will have to see when building it does it work. In Figma (see the link) there are frames for the website, the adding of resources (admin only) and the booking view (customers).
