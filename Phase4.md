# Project phase 4 - Project Presentation
The final stage of the Advanced Web Development project

## Use Cases
I had defined four use cases on my phase 1. This is how each one of those turned out.

### 1. Browsing the website

The set objectives were:

User: Customer
Functionality: 
+ The website is easy to navigate, logical and nice to look at
Outcome: 
+ The user gets the information they came to look for

The end result:

+ The website is logical and nice to look at. I set on a colour theme (green/yellow, white, black/dark brown for the text) which I though was suitable for the project, as it is quite nature connected. 
+ The page is a single page website. The banner stays on top of the page all the time. There are links in the banner to take the user straight to the desired topic if they don't want to scroll. The banner's logo works as a link to take the user to the top of the page.
+ The layout is the following: banner, big logo, about us (slighlty transparent info box on top of aerial view of a farmhouse environment), contact info (with phone number, email and an embedded Google Maps), a preview of the activities in a grid style (they work as links to the more detailed info) and then the big info parts of the activities in the same style as the about us-section but with the booking link included.
+ The booking possibility is a pop-up, appears when 'Book Now' button on a chosen activity is clicked
+ All the pictures are from copyright-free sources and the logo I made with AI
+ The info texts are also AI written, I decided that was a little bit of time saved for me
+ In conclusion, the set objectives were met

### 2. Setting bookable dates on the website

The set objectives were:

User: Admin
Functionality:
+ Choosing the date and time to appear on the website's "Booking" section
+ Publishing the dates
Outcome:
+ A form appears for the admin to fill/choose the dates
+ Confirmation is asked ("Are you sure you want to publish these dates?") before publishing
+ The published dates will appear on the "Booking" section of the website

The end result:

+ The admin dashboard has 'Set Available Times' section
+ The section has dropdown menu with calendar and clock where a date and time can be chosen. The date and time can also be written there if that is the way the admin wants to do it.
+ Once chosen, 'Save' should be clicked

### 3. Booking

The set objectives were:

### 4. Viewing the booked resources

The set objectives were:
